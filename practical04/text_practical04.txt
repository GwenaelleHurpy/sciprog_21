In this practical we use program blocks to calculat the trapezodial area. The results are stored into array. 

The two  programs are  writen in C. 
Library needed stdio.h and math.h

The trapezoidal2.c program calculates the value of tan(x) where x is in radians in the range of [0,60]. 

Function is  used to convert deg to radian

The trapezodial3.c program calculates the value under the curve of tan(x) [0,60] degrees using trapezoidal rule. 

Function is used to calculate the area using trapezoidal rule.

To compile the two programs  use -lm .
